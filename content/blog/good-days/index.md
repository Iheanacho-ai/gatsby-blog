S-e-l-f d-e-s-t-r-u-c-t-i-v-e, I need help

![Good Days](./good.jpg)

I've always been, s-e-l-f d-e-s-t-r-u-c-t-i-v-e
Can't you tell?


And they talking 'bout love, what is it?
Didn't know it existed
Now they telling me it's within myself

But, baby, what is love?

A figment? Tell me am I imagining shit?
Thinking about the lies I tell myself
I've always been


S-e-l-f d-e-s-t-r-u-c-t-i-v-e, I need help
'Cause I've always been, s-e-l-f d-e-s-t-r-u-c-t-i-v-e
Can't you tell?
That I've always been


S-e-l-f d-e-s-t-r-u-c-t-i-v-e, I need help
'Cause I've always been, s-e-l-f d-e-s-t-r-u-c-t-i-v-e
Can't you tell?
That I've always been
